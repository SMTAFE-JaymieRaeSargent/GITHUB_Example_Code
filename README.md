# GITHUB_Example_Code
The objective of this project is to design and develop a small but feature-complete Unity game prototype that simulates a simple RPG adventure experience. The game will integrate essential gameplay systems such as player movement, camera control, dialogue interactions, menus, and a basic saving/loading system. The projectâ€™s goal is to provide a cohesive gameplay experience where players can explore, interact, and progress through the adventure. The final product should highlight the development of a functional prototype that incorporates these systems seamlessly to create an engaging RPG experience.
